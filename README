How to build from source
========================
You don't require MCP to build this mod.

Building on Windows with JRE 6 or 7:
1. Run "gradlew build" in the project root.


Goals of the mod
================
1. Never depend on Minecraft version, don't break on updates. (Can this still be a thing? Only time will tell!)
   Only in cases of drastic feature change.
2. Enhance original Minecraft experience.
3. Enhance experience with Minecraft mods.
4. Prevent gameplay imbalance and use common sense.
5, Be open, flexible, customizable and compatible (Now it is YOURCRAFT!).
6. Be small, fast and straight to the point.


What this mod is not
====================
This is not a tool to create your own mods. It's only for tweaks.
Granted, there are many mods out there that are worth only for tweaks.
This mod can indeed eventually replace them.

Combine with Tabula Rasa for custom items and blocks.


Current features
================
tweaks_vanilla.js:
- Allows additional Minecraft blocks and items to be used as furnace fuel
- Allows bleaching wool with bone meal
tweaks_mods.js:
- Allows some mods' blocks and items to be used as furnace fuel
- Adds recipes for using mods' blocks and items between mods
- Adds Thaumcraft aspects for various blocks and items from other mods if Thaumcraft is installed.
equivalent_exchange.js:
- Probably going to be removed, along with the whole EE3 support section from tweaks_mods.js
thaumcraft.js:
- Provides functions for adding aspects to items and blocks.

- adds /eval command to execute JavaScript code


Supported mods
==============
Supported APIs:

  Equivalent Exchange 3
  Thaumcraft
  Industrial-Craft 2

Supported block/item IDs:

  Supported item ID's shouldn't be a thing to worry about any more due to names being assigned to blocks.


Limitations
===========
Currently requires Oracle Java 6 or 7. Maybe 8 is supported, but this is not tested.


Future
======
Look in TODO: https://raw.github.com/justastranger/moreeverything/master/TODO
