Easy
====
- Finish Tinkers Construct support.

Medium
======
- Allow changing/adding mob drops
  - add rare skulls drop


Hard/Tricky/Unknown
===================
- Use Forge's adding trades
	- It's apparently possible, but is a massive undocumented quagmire that I don't understand.

- Dispenser planting seeds


Maintenance/Boring
==================
- Add Thaumcraft aspects for mod items/blocks

- Write better documentation, etc.

- Make sure everything is standardized/doing the same things the same way

Future
======
- more Thaumcraft API support - Working on it I guess...
- recipes inspection to help adding missing ones (Missing whats?)
- allow changing chests loot
- plant more stuff in pots
- villagers drop last trade (if it's enabled) when killed by a player? Can this be done?
- on medium and especially hard difficulty, regenerating from full hunger bar makes player hungry
- charge double amount of XP instead of showing "too expensive!" on anvils
- change fishing interval? Can this be done?
- chicken mating makes an egg instead of a chicken; Can this be done?
  if possible, such an egg has 1/2 chance to hatch as opposed to 1/8
  if possible, such an egg hatches instead of disappearing in 5 minutes 
- use lapis in brewing potions - Create intermediate item, make brewing recipe for it, and change others to use it.
- make bookshelves have direction. Can this be done without adding a new block?


Forum suggestions
=================
- Forestry recipe support -- carpenter, centrifuge 
- GregTech -- Maybe?

  BlueDart disappeared off the face of the Earth, so this will never update.
